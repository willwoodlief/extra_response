has an exponential back off function, it includes the things to check which I listed below. But its a wrap around calling to a service that may be rate limited


utils.tryAgain = "force backoff anyway";
utils.backoffErrors = [
  "Exception: Service invoked too many times",
  "Exception: Rate Limit Exceeded",
  "Exception: Quota Error: User Rate Limit Exceeded",
  "Service error: Spreadsheets",
  "Exception: User rate limit exceeded",
  "Exception: Internal error. Please try again.",
  "Exception: Cannot execute AddColumn because another task",
  "Service invoked too many times in a short time:",
  "Exception: Internal error.",
  "Exception: Превышен лимит: DriveApp.",
  utils.tryAgain
];
